# Google Keep -> Notion

Exports notes and lists from Google Keep and imports them into your Notion.

## Features

Supports exporting:

- Notes
- TODO lists
- Images and audio (_unsupported in recent Notion API versions, stay tuned for updates_)
- Categorization via labels

## Installation

This script requires Python 3.9+, https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi, https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py, and a couple more libraries to run. Install the pre-requisite libraries via [Pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional: make the script executable:

```
chmod +x gkeep2notion.py
```

### Preventing "Authentication failed" on some systems

____
#### Running inside of a Docker Container
In order to use the `gkeepapi` dependency, you'll need to run it inside of a docker container that is compatible with it. Otherwise you'll most likely run into an "Authentication failed" error.

1. Build the Docker Image
```
docker build -t gkeep2notion_image .
```
2. Run the Docker Container
```
docker run -it --name gkeep2notion_container gkeep2notion_image /bin/bash
```
3. Now you should be inside the container and the rest of the guide should work
____

On some systems the authentication fails even with valid credentials. This may happen because of three reasons:
1. You have enabled 2FA on your account
2. Google issues a CAPTCHA for your IP address
3. SSL certificate validation fails.


**To fix the 2FA problem:**

You need to create an app specific password for the script.

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Login to your account
3. Under the `Select the app and device you want to generate the app password for.` section:
    1. Select `Other(Custom name)` from the `Select app` dropdown
    2. Enter some name like `gkeep2notion` and click on `Generate` button
    3. Copy password from the popup and click Done
4. Use this copied password in your terminal when script prompts for password

**To fix the CAPTCHA problem:**

Try using the [Unlock CAPTCHA link](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) before retrying login.

**To try fixing the SSL problem:***

Revert to an older version of the following library:

```
pip3 install requests==2.23.0
```

## Configuration

Before use, copy _config.example.ini_ to _config.ini_ and edit its contents. See configuration explanation below:

```ini
[gkeep]
email=your_name@gmail.com # Your Google account
import_notes=true # Set to false if you don't want to import notes
import_todos=true # Set to false if you don't want to import TODO lists
import_media=true # Set to false if you don't need to import images and audio

[notion]
token=Copy it from your Notion integratin # See documentation below
root_url=https://notion.so/PAGE-ID Create a root url in your Notion # See documentation below
```

### Obtaining Notion token

The importer needs to access your Notion account and it needs to know the root URL in which to import all the Google Keep contents.

To get a Notion authentication token:

1. Go to your [Notion integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click _"Create new integration"_
3. Enter any name, e.g. `gkeep2notion`. As per Integration type, choose _Internal integration_. In the _Capabilities_ make sure this integration can Read, Update, and Insert content.
4. After creating the integration copy the _"Internal Integration Token"_ value to the `token` in your `config.ini`.

### Configuring the root_url

This script imports all the content under a certain page in Notion that has to exist already. It is recommended to create a special page for the imported content, and then migrate it to your regular Notion structure from there.

1. Create a new page in Notion e.g. _"Google Keep import"_
2. Click on `•••` button on top right of the page and select _"Add Connections"_ (at the bottom) from the menu.
3. Search for your integration name and select it. You should press _"Confirm"_ on the dialog that will appear. This will make the page accessible to your integration.
4. Copy the URL of the page in the address bar or use _"Copy link"_ in the context menu of the navigation bar
5. Paste that link to `root_url` in the _config.ini_.

## Usage

### Google authentication

The first time you run `gkeep2notion` it will ask for your Google Account's password to authenticate into your Google Keep account. After obtaining an authentication token, `gkeep2notion` saves it in your system's keyring. Next time you won't need to enter the password again.

### Import everything

_Note: export/import takes a considerable amount of time. Especially when working with notes containing media files. So you may want to try importing a subset of your records before importing everything._

By default gkeep2notion exports everything in your Google Keep account and imports it into Notion. It can be done as simple as:

```bash
./gkeep2notion.py
```

### Google Keep search query

You can use the search function built into Google Keep to import notes matching a search query:

```bash
./gkeep2notion.py -q 'Orange apple'
```

### Import specific labels

You can import notes and tasklists containing specific label(s) in Google Keep using the `-l` option.

An example with one label:

```bash
./gkeep2notion.py -l cooking
```

An example with multiple labels, comma separated:

```bash
./gkeep2notion.py -l 'work, business, management'
```
